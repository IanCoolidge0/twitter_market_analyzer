# twitter_market_analyzer
Senior project for the Academy for Science and Design, 2019. DJIA and Twitter datasets not included due to large size.

## Dependencies:

* NumPy 1.14.3+
* Keras
* Tweepy
* Pickle
* wxPython (for application only)
* MyGrad by @rsokl (for sliding_window_view function only)

## Notes:

The application file is run.py, and should be accessed via terminal with 2GB+ allocated RAM. Current-day predictions will not work currently; these require a Twitter developer account and the consumer and access tokens should be entered into lines 11-14 of the run.py source code.
