1. I'm using Twitter's APIs to attempt to use machine learning to find correlations between public sentiment and stock prices. This is part of a high school senior project, and thus the results will likely not be published in any significant academic sense.
2.  I plan to analyze Tweets to determine overall sentiment, possibly regarding a certain stock. This analysis will consist purely of positive/negative sentiment analysis, and will not base its testing on any other factors - that is, no sensitive information will be inferred at any time. Opinions about a specific stock will only be obtained from positive/negative sentiment on tweets regarding that stock. (Note: positive/negative sentiment has been expanded to 6-dimensional POMS sentiment.)
3.  I will not be Tweeting content with my system.
4. Individual Tweets and content will not be displayed in any capacity through this project. Information displayed will be aggregate, comparing time series of Twitter data versus stock data.
